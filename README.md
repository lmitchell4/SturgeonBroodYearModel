=======

This repository contains all the necessary files to run the MitchellModelApp. This application provides a model to observe San Francisco Estuary sturgeon annual young-of-the-year recruitment index. The code-behind the model and the model interface are the result of collaborative work between CA Department of Fish and Wildlife and US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Disclaimer: as of 10-Aug-2015 the model is still being developed. So results or model output should not be interpreted as gospel (J. DuBois).
